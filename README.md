# MMM-Vasttrafik-PublicTransport
[Magic Mirror](https://magicmirror.builders/) Module - Display public transport operated by Västtrafik for western part of Sweden, including Gothenburg. This module use the API's provided by [Västtrafik](https://www.vasttrafik.se).

## Prerequisites
### 1. Create application and obtain required client id and secret
You need to obtain your own application key and secret from Västtrafik by creating a new application.

1. Navigate to [https://developer.vasttrafik.se](https://developer.vasttrafik.se) and create your own developer account.
2. Create new application under [https://developer.vasttrafik.se/portal/#/applications](https://developer.vasttrafik.se/portal/#/applications)

### 2. Create application subscription 
You need to obtain application subscription for [Reseplaneraren v2](https://developer.vasttrafik.se/portal/#/api/Reseplaneraren/v2/landerss/direct)

1. Navigate to [https://developer.vasttrafik.se/portal/#/subscriptions](https://developer.vasttrafik.se/portal/#/subscriptions)
2. Create new subscription for your newly created application so that we can queary Reseplaneraren v2.

#### 2.1 Traffic situtaions (optional)
If you would like to get traffic situations for your stops, you also need to subscribe to [TrafficSituations v1](https://developer.vasttrafik.se/portal/#/api/TrafficSituations/v1/admin) and set ```trafficSituations``` in configs to true.

1. Navigate to [https://developer.vasttrafik.se/portal/#/subscriptions](https://developer.vasttrafik.se/portal/#/subscriptions)
2. Create new subscription for your application so that we can queary TrafficSituations v1.


### 3. Get stops that you want to track
Last thing todo is to find the required stop id:s that you would like to track. 

1. Navigate to the API consol for [Reseplaneraren v2](https://developer.vasttrafik.se/portal/#/api/Reseplaneraren/v2/landerss)
2. Use any of the location endpoints to obatin the stop id. 

Exampel request url ([access token] could be retrived from the developer portal - API console directly, https://developer.vasttrafik.se/portal/#/api/Reseplaneraren/v2/landerss, or by  following this guide: https://developer.vasttrafik.se/portal/#/guides/oauth2):

                    min: 0,
                    color: "#660202"
                },
                {

                }
            ]
        }
    },
    ...
]
```
### Filtered board
If you want to filter the departure board you could do that by setting configs for "filterAttr" and "filterKey". Both settings needs to be set if used. Default is null. You _can_ filter on multiple keys, so for example you can filter on multiple tracks by setting the filterKeys to ["A", "B"].  

#### Example A - filter on Track:
So in order to filter the board on Track A. You could do that by simply setting "filterAttr" to "track" and "filterKeys" to ["A"]. This will remove all other tracks from the board. The same goes for "direction", "line" or "type".

```js
config: {
                    .....
                    filterAttr: "track",
                    filterKeys: ["A"]
                    ....
        }
```

![Example of filter on track](https://github.com/bureus/MMM-Vasttrafik-PublicTransport/blob/master/docs/filterOnTrack.PNG)

#### Example B - filter on Line:
So in order to filter the board on Line 4. Change config settings "filterAttr" to "line" and "filterKeys" to ["4"]. This will remove all other lines from the board.

```js
config: {
                    .....
                    filterAttr: "line",
                    filterKeys: "4"
                    ....
        }
```

### Departure time colors
Based on a feature request from @fillilutten there is now support to give you colorful warnings based on time (minutes) until departure. The functionality will give you the possibility to configure as many colors/warnings as you like. Only limitation is that two colors cant be active for the same departure time span. 
 
To set color warnings you need to set two optional configurations "enableDepartureTimeColors" to "true" and add an array of departureTimeColor objects to "departureTimeColors" collection. the "departureTimeColor" object consists of three attributes. "max", which is maximum min until departure, "min" which is minimal time to departure and "color" which is the hex code representing the color which the warning should be rendered with, see example.
 
#### Example - Departure warning by colors:
Below configurations will give your board four different color warnings depending on time until departure. If departure time is within 1 min to departure the time remaining will be dark red (#660202), if departure time is within or equal two 2 - 4 mins it will be light red (#FF0000), if departure time is within 4 - 6 mins it will be yellow (#FFF200) and within 7 - 15 mins it will be light green (#52FF33)


```js
config: {
                    .....
                    enableDepartureTimeColors: true,
                    departureTimeColors: [
                    {
                        max: 1,
                        min: 0,
                        color: "#660202"
                    },
                    {
                      max: 4,
                      min: 2,
                      color: "#FF0000"
                    },
                    {
                      max: 6,
                      min: 4,
                      color: "#FFF200"
                    },
                    {
                      max: 15,
                      min: 7,
                      color: "#52FF33"
                    }
                  ]
                    ....
        }
```

### Minimal layout
If you are after minimal width or design, you should set showTrackNumbers, showDestinationName and showStopHeader to false. This will render the board like this:

![Example of minimal board](https://github.com/bureus/MMM-Vasttrafik-PublicTransport/blob/master/docs/extendedConfigs.PNG)

## Supports multi stops and translations
You can add a list of stop ids if you want to track multiple stops. Current supported languages are Swedish (sv) and English (en) and set in MagicMirror configurations.

![Example of swedish translation and tracking two stops](https://github.com/bureus/MMM-Vasttrafik-PublicTransport/blob/master/docs/swedishAndMultistops.PNG)

## Get traffic situations for your stops
You can get ongoing traffic situations or planned maintenance (swedish only) for your stops by setting traffic situtation flag to true in configs. Please keep in mind that you need to subscribe to TrafficSituations v1 API. See Prerequisites 2.1.
